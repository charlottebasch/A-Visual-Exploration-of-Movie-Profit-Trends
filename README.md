## A Visual Exploration of Movie Profit Trends

* By Charlotte Basch with Rachel Beery 


#  Introduction

Before the events of the Coronavirus pandemic, the film industry was a tremendously profitable business. In 2019, global box office revenue reached 42.5 billion dollars. In this project we explored data about movie production from 2010 to 2018 using pandas to work with datasets and make visualizations. This project contains data we were given for the module one project in order to make recommendations to Microsoft if they were considering going into the movie business. We were provided with datasets from IMDB, TMDb, and The Numbers. These datasets provided information on movie titles, years, runtime, genres, budgets, profits, and other related variables. The data also contained audience ratings. We focused on three questions about what factors are related to film grosses.

## Questions:
- Do IMDB user ratings relate to profit or budget?
- What genres are the most profitable?
- Does runtime affect movie gross?


# Conclusion

- Online rating should not be used when making decisions about budget or to predict profit. 
- Action, animation, sci-fi, and adventure movies are the most profitable genres. However smaller grossing genres still make a lot of profit. Additionally, many of these genres overlap so the profits observed are not completely additive. 
- Runtime is not related to movie gross unless it is unusually short. 

The movie business continues to expand and by examining the data and isolating the relevant factors, Microsoft would be able to maximize their profits in this kind of endeavor.
