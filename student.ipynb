    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before the events of the Coronavirus pandemic, the film industry was a tremendously profitable business. In <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8547827/2019-global-box-office-revenue-hit-record-425b-despite-4-percent-dip-in-us#:~:text=Global%20box%20office%20revenue%20hit%20a%20record%20%2442.5%20billion%20in,%2411.88%20billion%2C%20according%20to%20Comscore.\" target=\"_blank\">2019</a>, global box office revenue reached 42.5 billion dollars. In this project we explored data about movie production from 2010 to 2018 using pandas to work with datasets and make visualizations. This project contains data we were given for the module one project in order to make recommendations to Microsoft if they were considering going into the movie business. We were provided with datasets from IMDB, TMDb, and The Numbers. These datasets provided information on movie titles, years, runtime, genres, budgets, profits, and other related variables. The data also contained audience ratings. We focused on three questions about what factors are related to film grosses. "
